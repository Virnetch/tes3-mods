An overhaul of the mark and recall system using MWSE 2.1 to allow:

- Multiple mark locations, even from other mods. Teleport companions to your location. Limit number of marks by mysticism.
- Higher magicka cost and lower cast chance for long recall distances.
- Limited number of daily recalls.

Features can be changed in MCM

## Enchanted Weapon Resistance - [<img alt="Nexus" src="https://images.nexusmods.com/favicons/PaleBrown/favicon.ico" width="20" height="20" /> Download](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50194)
- Using MWSE-Lua Automatically changes the Ignore normal weapon resistance flag for all enchanted weapons and ammunition to be the same as an unenchanted item with the same mesh.
- Blocks cast-on-strike enchantments from triggering when the item has no effect on the target.

## Enchantment Services Redone - [<img alt="Nexus" src="https://images.nexusmods.com/favicons/PaleBrown/favicon.ico" width="20" height="20" /> Download](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/51249)
Adds NPC services for recharging enchanted items, deciphering magic scrolls and the option to transcribe magic scrolls, both by the player, and through a service. Adds empty scrolls from OAAB to enchanters and booksellers, and disables the passive recharging of enchanted items. Highly customizable through the Mod Config Menu. Inspired by [svengineer99](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/1121630)'s [MWSE 2.1 Enchantment Services](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45554)

## Hotkeys Extended - [<img alt="Nexus" src="https://images.nexusmods.com/favicons/PaleBrown/favicon.ico" width="20" height="20" /> Download](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48055)
Expands the vanilla Quick Menu by adding different hotkeys for holding or double tapping a button and/or when holding a specific button. All hotkeys use the same keys as in vanilla. In total there can now be 81 different hotkeyed items/spells.

## HUD Weapon Charge - [<img alt="Nexus" src="https://images.nexusmods.com/favicons/PaleBrown/favicon.ico" width="20" height="20" /> Download](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47962)
Adds a fillbar that shows the currently equipped weapon's charge under the weapon condition bar on the HUD.

## Protective Helmets - [<img alt="Nexus" src="https://images.nexusmods.com/favicons/PaleBrown/favicon.ico" width="20" height="20" /> Download](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50280)
Automatically adds resistances to diseases and poisons when wearing a closed helmet. This is mostly to make traveling in a blight storm more immersive while wearing a helmet with a mod that adds a chance to catch the disease from the storms. Inspired by Protective Masks originally by [WanderRA](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/2027229), and [rereleased](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068) by [Half11](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/36879320).

Adds tooltips to shrines on hovering over the different options, describing the effects a blessing has.

Includes compatibility for shrines from [Tamriel_Data](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537), [OAAB_Data](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042), [mtrDaedricOfferings](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49697) and [Solstheim - AllMaker's Blessings](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50416)
