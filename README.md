## Enchanted Weapon Resistance
- Using MWSE-Lua Automatically changes the Ignore normal weapon resistance flag for all enchanted weapons and ammunition to be the same as an unenchanted item with the same mesh.
- Blocks cast-on-strike enchantments from triggering when the item has no effect on the target.

<br>

## Enchantment Services Redone
Adds NPC services for recharging enchanted items, deciphering magic scrolls and the option to transcribe magic scrolls, both by the player, and through a service. Adds empty scrolls from OAAB to enchanters and booksellers, and disables the passive recharging of enchanted items. Highly customizable through the Mod Config Menu. Inspired by [svengineer99](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/1121630)'s [MWSE 2.1 Enchantment Services](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45554)

<br>

## Hotkeys Extended
Expands the vanilla Quick Menu by adding different hotkeys for holding or double tapping a button and/or when holding a specific button. All hotkeys use the same keys as in vanilla. In total there can now be 81 different hotkeyed items/spells.

<br>

## Protective Helmets
Automatically adds resistances to diseases and poisons when wearing a closed helmet. This is mostly to make traveling in a blight storm more immersive while wearing a helmet with a mod that adds a chance to catch the disease from the storms. Inspired by Protective Masks originally by [WanderRA](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/2027229), and [rereleased](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068) by [Half11](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/36879320).

## Shrine Tooltips
Adds tooltips to shrines on hovering over the different options, describing the effects a blessing has.

Includes compatibility for shrines from [Tamriel_Data](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44537), [OAAB_Data](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49042), [mtrDaedricOfferings](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49697) and [Solstheim - AllMaker's Blessings](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50416)
