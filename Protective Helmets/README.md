        Protective Helmets v1.0.2
            By Virnetch

---

### Requirements

- [Latest MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102)
- MWSE 2.1 (included with MGE XE)

### Features

> _Automatically adds resistances to diseases and poisons when wearing a closed helmet_

Automatically adds resistances to diseases and poisons when wearing a closed helmet. This is mostly to make traveling in a blight storm more immersive while wearing a helmet with a mod that adds a chance to catch the disease from the storms. Inspired by Protective Masks originally by [WanderRA](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/2027229), and [re-released](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/47068) by [Half11](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/users/36879320).

The effects behave in the same way as a constant enchantment, but are added when equipping the item instead of editing the original object, thus being compatible with enchanted items.

- Affected helmets can be blacklisted to remove the resistances.
- Non-full helmets (i.e. don't hide the head model) can also be whitelisted to add the resistances.
- The added effects can be toggled and magnitudes changed in the MCM.

### Recommended Mods

- [Consistent Enchanting](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50029) - Player-enchanted helmets will respect the original helmets black-/whitelisting with this mod installed
- [Vanilla Friendly Wearables Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48683) - Includes some masks/scarfs that are whitelisted by default
