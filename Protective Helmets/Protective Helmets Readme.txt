=============
Requirements

Morrowind

Latest MGE XE: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102
MWSE 2.1: https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip

============
Description
============
Automatically adds resistances to diseases and poisons when wearing a closed helmet.
This is mostly to make traveling in a blight storm more immersive while wearing a helmet with a mod that adds a chance to catch the disease from the storms. Inspired by Protective Masks originally by WanderRA, and rereleased by Half11.
The effects behave in the same way as a constant enchantment, but are added when equipping the item without editing the original object, thus being compatible with enchanted items.

 - Affected helmets can be blacklisted to remove the resistances.
 - Non-full helmets (i.e. don't hide the head model) can also be whitelisted to add the resistances.
 - The added effects can be toggled and magnitudes changed in the MCM.

Recommended mods:
 - Consistent Enchanting - Player-enchanted helmets will respect the original helmets black-/whitelisting with this mod installed
 - Vanilla Friendly Wearables Expansion - Includes some masks/scarfs that are whitelisted by default

 - Ashfall, The Blight, Blighted Blight, or Blight Storms Restored - To add blight to blight storms
 - Creeping Blight - To spread the blight storms
 - The Blight - To spread the blight (and lots of other cool stuff)
 - Lucevar has a list of other blight related mods: https://github.com/Lucevar/mw-immersion-mods/blob/master/articles/blight.md
