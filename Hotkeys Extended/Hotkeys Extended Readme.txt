Requirements
=============
Morrowind

Latest MGE XE: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102
MWSE 2.1: https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip

============
Description
============
Expands the vanilla Quick Menu by adding different hotkeys for holding or double tapping a button and/or when holding a specific button. All hotkeys use the same keys as in vanilla. In total there can now be 81 different hotkeyed items/spells. Requires MWSE 2.1

- Hotkeys are separated into three groups when holding no button, or by default left shift or left alt. You can change these keys to any button you like.
- Hotkeys can be a single tap, hold, or double tap.
- Hotkeys use the same settings as in vanilla, so you can also set them to mouse buttons.
- You can hotkey any item that can be equipped or used, any spell, or any enchanted item or scroll.

- Add hotkeys by opening the vanilla Quick Menu.
- If the menu doesn't show correctly, disable the Show All Menus option in the Mod Config Menu.

I may add hotkeys for any button, but currently it uses the same ones as in vanilla.

Changelog
============
1.1.3
 - Added an option to change the time between key presses for it to be considered a double tap.
1.1.2
 - Added the option to show the different Quick Menu windows on different pages when opening the Quick Menu. This should work better with lower resolutions or the UI Scaling feature in MGE XE.
 - Other minor changes
1.1.1
 - Hotkeys now work with soul gems
 - Fixed some bugs with readying weapon/hands
1.1
 - If a hotkey with a weapon is pressed while attacking with another weapon, the hotkeyed weapon will be equipped after ending the attack
