        Hotkeys Extended v1.1.3
            By Virnetch

---

### Requirements

- [Latest MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102)
- MWSE 2.1 (included with MGE XE)

### Features

> _Expands the vanilla Quick Menu by adding different hotkeys for holding or double tapping a button and/or when holding a specific button_

- Hotkeys are separated into three groups: when holding no button, or, by default, when holding either left shift or left alt. You can change the modifier-keys to any button you like.
- Hotkeys can be a single tap, hold, or double tap.
- Hotkeys use the same settings as in vanilla, so you can also set them to mouse buttons.
- Add hotkeys by opening the vanilla Quick Menu.

### Recommended Mods

- [No Combat Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46732)
- [Quick Loadouts](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/46708)

### Changelog

#### 1.1.3

- Added an option to change the time between key presses for it to be considered a double tap.

#### 1.1.2

- Other minor changes

#### 1.1.1

- Fixed some bugs with readying weapon/hands

#### 1.1.0

- If a hotkey with a weapon is pressed while attacking with another weapon, the hotkeyed weapon will be equipped after ending the attack

#### 1.0.0

- Initial release.

### Installation

- Make sure you have the latest versions of [MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) and MWSE 2.1. MWSE-Update.exe in the Morrowind installation folder will update MWSE to the latest version.

- Drop the MWSE folder inside your `Morrowind/Data files` folder or install with a mod organizer.

- Open the Mod Config Menu after launching the game to tweak options to your liking.

### Removal

- Delete the `Data files/mwse/mods/Virnetch/HotKeys` folder.

### Incompatibilities

- Requires MWSE to work, so it is currently incompatible with OpenMW.

- No known incompatibilities with other mods.

### Permissions

- Modify my mod, but credit me as the original creator

### Credits

- Thanks to NullCascade, Hrnchamd and other developers of MWSE and MGE XE.
