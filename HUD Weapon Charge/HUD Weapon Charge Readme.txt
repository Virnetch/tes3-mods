Latest MGE XE: https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102
MWSE 2.1: https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip

============
Description
============
Adds a fillbar that shows the currently equipped weapons charge under the weapon condition bar on the HUD.

 - In vanilla Morrowind there is a fillbar under the currently equipped enchanted item's icon showing how much charge is left on it. This mod adds a similar bar under the equipped weapon's icon if it has a Cast on Strike enchantment so that you can quickly see the charge left on it.

============
Changelog
============
1.1
 - Added Mod Config Menu with options to change the color and thickness of the fillbar.
 - Fillbar only shows up for Cast on Strike weapons. (Can be disabled in MCM).
