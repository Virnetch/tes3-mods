        HUD Weapon Charge v1.1.0
            By Virnetch

---

### Requirements

- [Latest MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102)
- MWSE 2.1 (included with MGE XE)

### Features

> _Adds a fillbar that shows the currently equipped weapon's charge under the weapon condition bar on the HUD._

In vanilla Morrowind there is a fillbar under the currently equipped enchanted item's icon showing how much charge is left on it. This mod adds a similar bar under the equipped enchanted weapon's icon, so that you can quickly see the charge left on it.

The mod doesn't change the color of the vanilla fillbar, but if you want it to use the same color as this one, change **color_magic_fill=200,60,30** to **color_magic_fill=53,69,159** in `Morrowind.ini`

### Changelog

#### 1.1.0

- Added Mod Config Menu with options to change the color and thickness of the fillbar.
- Fillbar only shows up for Cast on Strike weapons. (Can be disabled in MCM).

#### 1.0.0

- Initial release.

### Installation

- Make sure you have the latest versions of [MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) and MWSE 2.1. MWSE-Update.exe in the Morrowind installation folder will update MWSE to the latest version.

- Drop the MWSE folder inside your `Morrowind/Data files` folder or install with a mod organizer.

- Open the Mod Config Menu after launching the game to tweak options to your liking.

### Removal

- Delete the `Data files/mwse/mods/Virnetch/HUDWeaponCharge` folder.

### Incompatibilities

- Requires MWSE to work, so it is currently incompatible with OpenMW.

- No known incompatibilities with other mods.

### Permissions

- Modify my mod, but credit me as the original creator
