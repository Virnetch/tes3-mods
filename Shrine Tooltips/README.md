### Installation

- Make sure you have the latest versions of [MGE XE](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) and MWSE 2.1. MWSE-Update.exe in the Morrowind installation folder will update MWSE to the latest version.

- Drop the MWSE folder inside your `Morrowind/Data files` folder or install with a mod organizer.

- Open the Mod Config Menu after launching the game to tweak options to your liking.

### Removal

- Delete the `Data files/mwse/mods/Virnetch/ShrineTooltips` folder.

### Known issues

- With some resolutions the tooltip may be covered by a black box when it is inside the MenuMessage menu. This happens in the vanilla game as well, but only with some resolutions. Changing the resolution or Menu UI scaling in MGE XE may fix this

### Incompatibilities

- Requires MWSE to work, so it is currently incompatible with OpenMW.

- Mods that edit blessings should be compatible and show the correct tooltip as long as they only edit the original spells. Mods that add new blessing spells need to be added to this mod's config file to have tooltips. If you find a blessing without a tooltip, let me know the mod that adds it and I can add it to the mod.

### Permissions

- Modify my mod, but credit me as the original creator

### Credits

- Thanks to NullCascade, Hrnchamd and other developers of MWSE and MGE XE.
